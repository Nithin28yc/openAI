Summary:
The test report provides details on the automation test run, including the number of tests, test steps, and time taken. It also identifies a critical concern regarding the failure of the unsecure session management control to validate user sessions and suggests remedial measures for implementing appropriate session timeouts, secure storage, and prevention of session fixation attacks. The report displays the test case failure for sessionManagement and provides an overview of the specific failures, along with a configuration for the test counts and selection for test status. Moreover, it includes JavaScript code to customize the ExtentReports logo.

Remediation for how to fix the issue:
To address the issue of the unsecure session management control failing to validate user sessions, appropriate measures such as implementing session timeouts, secure storage mechanisms, and session fixation attack prevention measures need to be taken. The session timeout should be set based on the risk profile of the application, the sensitivity and the amount of data processed or stored. Secure storage mechanisms such as encryption techniques should be used for storing session data in the server-side. The prevention of session fixation attacks can be done using various techniques such as regeneration of session ID on successful login, session tokenization and hashing, to name a few. The implementation of these measures would ensure the security of user sessions and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Summary: The test report summary provides information about the ExtentReports version, total tests and steps, time taken, environment details, and a section for filtering test results and updating the report logo. However, the report notes that the data masking control failed to meet required standards, leading to compromised data confidentiality and failed test cases.

Remediation for how to fix the issue: To address the data confidentiality issue, the data masking control needs to meet the required standards. This could involve implementing stronger data encryption or improving access controls. Additionally, all failed test cases related to the data masking control should be retested once the issue has been resolved. It is crucial for the testing team to prioritize data confidentiality and security measures to ensure that any potential vulnerabilities are addressed.

Summary: The ZAP scanning tool generated a report for http://a34ffe14581144f8a914f8ece9390834-2125881336.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com on 23rd August 2023. There were no high-risk alerts, but four medium risk, three low-risk, and two informational alerts were identified. The alerts included Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens, Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set, Missing Anti-clickjacking Header, Sub Resource Integrity Attribute Missing, Permissions Policy Header Not Set, Server Leaks Version Information via "Server" HTTP Response Header Field, X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing, Non-Storable Content, and Storable and Cacheable Content. The report provided detailed descriptions, evidence, instances, and solutions for each alert. 

Remediation: To address the identified issues and improve the security of the scanned site, appropriate measures need to be taken. These may include implementing Anti-CSRF Tokens, setting the CSP Header, implementing Anti-clickjacking Header, adding the Sub Resource Integrity Attribute, and setting the Permissions Policy Header. Additionally, the site needs to stop leaking version information via the "Server" HTTP Response Header Field, set the X-Content-Type-Options Header, and remove Non-Storable Content. Furthermore, the site needs to ensure that any storable and cacheable content is secure. Accessing relevant resources provided in the report can also assist in addressing these issues.
