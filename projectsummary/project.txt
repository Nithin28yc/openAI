Issue Summary: The test reports identify critical concerns regarding unsecure session management control, compromised data confidentiality, and vulnerabilities in the scanned site.

Vulnerabilities:
- Unsecure session management control failing to validate user sessions
- Data masking control failing to meet required standards, leading to compromised data confidentiality
- Medium and low-risk vulnerabilities in the scanned site, including absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens, missing headers, and storable and cacheable content.

Remediation Steps:
- Implement appropriate session timeouts, secure storage mechanisms, and session fixation attack prevention measures for the unsecure session management control.
- Meet required standards for the data masking control by implementing stronger data encryption or improving access controls.
- Address the identified vulnerabilities in the scanned site by implementing relevant headers, attributes, and content security measures.

Overall Conclusion:
The identified vulnerabilities in the test reports pose significant risks to the security and confidentiality of user data. Implementing the recommended remediation steps is crucial to ensure the security of user sessions and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Additionally, prioritizing data confidentiality and security measures is essential to address any potential vulnerabilities and improve the overall security of the tested systems.
