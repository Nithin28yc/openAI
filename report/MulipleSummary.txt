Issue: Unsecure Session Management Vulnerability

Summary: The test case "sessionManagement" has failed due to the application failing the Unsecure Session Management Vulnerability. This vulnerability can allow an attacker to hijack a user's session and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Remediation: To fix this issue, the application needs to implement secure session management techniques such as using secure cookies, session timeouts, and session regeneration after login. Additionally, the application should ensure that session IDs are not exposed in URLs and that session data is encrypted and stored securely. A thorough security review of the application should also be conducted to identify and address any other potential vulnerabilities.
